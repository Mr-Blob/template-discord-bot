To run a Python bot you need the following:

Go to: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0.exe

When you first run that .exe make sure to look at the bottom and tick the box that says about adding it the PATH this is very important.
Then just click the top install.

Unfortunatly I need you to also install git. You can uninstall this later though.
https://git-scm.com/download/win
You can just click next one everything.


Right, now I need you to open up cmd.exe

Once in there type this command: python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py@rewrite

If you want the music to work: python -m pip install -U youtube_dl
And install OPUS

After you have done this what I need you to do is Download the files of this page. Theres a green button at the top. Just click it, and press Download ZIP. Unzip the files and put them where you want.


At the bottom of the file you see it says: bot.run('token')
Replace the word token with your token.


This is when you need to go to your chosen editor.

Add your code.

Then save it.

Go to where ever the file is and double click.
